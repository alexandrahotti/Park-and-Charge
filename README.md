# ParkShark
A React Native prototype for a project aimed at sharing private electric vehicle charging stations in Stockholm.

## Executive Summary
Park&Charge is a high-fidelity prototype application built and designed by us, 5 KTH students, to
showcase a sharing economy solution to target the lack of charging stations for electric vehicles (EV)
in Stockholm. This problem was presented to us by Stockholms Stad during early fall 2019. Since
then we have designed, tested, prototyped and built a solution to said problem. Our final product has
been developed based on feedback and assistance through surveys, interviews and usability testing
involving many different types of expertise and perspectives. This report has been written to describe
exactly what we have done as well as how and why we have done it. The report starts off by discussing
the overall problem and quickly describes our solution to said problem. It then delves deeper into the
context of the problem, the market in which it exists and the actors within said market. The report
then proceeds to thoroughly discuss the key stakeholders, the target group, the design process and
the technical implementation of that design. Thereafter the report describes the business plan of how
our application would fare on the marketplace before discussing a set of key issues further. Finally,
we present the way forward - what should come next.
